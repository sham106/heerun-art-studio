Instructions: Create a new Google Form and copy each question/title above into new form fields; use the suggested field type. For file upload fields, enable file upload (Google Forms requires sign-in for file upload). After the form is ready, share the link with the client and collect responses.

If you want, I can create the Google Form for you (I will need edit access to a Google account or you can create and share the link). Alternatively I can export the questions to a fillable PDF upon request.
